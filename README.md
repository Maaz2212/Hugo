# 🤖 Hugo — Reactive Intelligence for Procurement

Hugo is an **agentic AI co-pilot** designed to help procurement and operations teams detect risks, reason over operational data, and take **evidence-backed actions** with speed and clarity.

It simulates a real enterprise workflow where **supplier emails** act as operational signals that trigger **AI-driven reactive intelligence**.

---

## 🚀 What Hugo Does

- 📩 Simulates supplier emails (delay, quality issue, cancellation, price change)
- 👀 Watches incoming `.eml` files in real time
- 🤖 Uses **Gemini AI** to extract structured intelligence
- 🧠 Reasons about risk, impact, and recommendations
- 📊 Renders results in a **human-in-the-loop dashboard**

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Hugo
```
### Create a Python Virtual Environment

Create the environment at the project root:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
### Activate it:
```
macOS / Linux

source venv/bin/activate


Windows

venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Set Gemini API Key

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:
```
macOS / Linux

export GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>


Windows

set GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```
### 4️⃣ Install Backend Dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 5️⃣ Start the Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will start at:

```http://localhost:5173```

### 6️⃣ Start the Backend

Open a new terminal, activate the virtual environment again, then:
```
cd backend
python server.py
```
### ▶️ How to Use the Application
```
Open http://localhost:5173
```
 in your browser

Navigate to the Send tab

Choose one of the predefined email templates
or create a fresh custom email

Click Simulate Email

Wait a few seconds while the AI processes the email

View the results in the Dashboard panel

### 📊 What the Dashboard Shows

Each alert generated by Hugo includes:

Event Category (e.g. quality issue, delay)

Risk Level (high / moderate / low)

AI Reasoning

Operational Evidence

Impact Analysis

Recommended Actions

Affected Departments

All insights are explainable and traceable to data.

### 🎥 Demo Video

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Python

AI: Google Gemini

Data: CSVs + simulated .eml ingestion

Architecture: Event-driven, human-in-the-loop

### 🧠 Why Hugo Matters

Hugo demonstrates how agentic AI can:

React to real operational signals

Reason across messy enterprise data

Support decision-making instead of replacing humans

This is Reactive Intelligence, not just analytics.

### 📌 Notes

mockdata.ts is used as a temporary persistence layer for hackathon speed

In production, this would be replaced by APIs or event streams
